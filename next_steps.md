# Next Steps

1.  **Waiting for your files:** I am currently waiting for you to provide the sample data extraction Excel file and the custom HTML form.
2.  **Analysis:** Once I receive the files, I will analyze them to understand the data structure, the fields you are using, and the layout of the data entry form.
3.  **Refine the plan:** Based on my analysis, I will refine the data models we discussed (`Study`, `CustomField`, `CustomData`) and create a detailed plan for implementing the data extraction feature. This will include:
    *   Updating the database models.
    *   Creating the necessary forms.
    *   Building the user interface for data entry.

In short, the next step is for me to analyze the files you provide to ensure that what we build matches your requirements.
