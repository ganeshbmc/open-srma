# Changelog â€” 2025-10-04

## Summary
Added per-section controls on the customize form page so editors can launch field creation directly within the relevant section.

## Details
- Injected a section-specific Add Field button into each customization card header for quicker contextual edits.
- Updated the add-field view to honor an optional section query parameter, preselecting the originating section in the form wizard.
- Left the global Add Field control intact for teams that prefer a single entry point.

## Tests / Checks
- not run (UI-only change)
